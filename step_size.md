# thought about step size
firs, I search the paper about how to compute the optimlal step size in gradient descent, according to the answer [1], I know that in general gradient computation process, we ignore the appeal about get the optimal step size with respect to the current gradient. If we want, we must evulate the step size at eatch gradient update, this is complex and ineffcient.
