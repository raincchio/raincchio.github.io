There are many discussion about Legendre transform, in math or physics. But after searching the internet, I found it's not very to get a initivie about this transfofmation.

Here, I will discusiion it in my own thought.

First, why we use Legendre transform ?

In fact, in many situation, we use this transformation for esay optimiziton. and this transformation is alwasy equaltiy.


$\mathrm{d} f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathrm{d}x + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathrm{d}y$
